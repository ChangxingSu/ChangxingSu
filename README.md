I'm ~~a tree🌳 in the random forest~~ trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

- 🔬 Research-wise, I'm mainly working on topics related to gaining mechanistic insights about human diseases by applying modern computational methods to modern **multi-omics data**.
- 🎯 I'm caring about reproducible research and open science.
- 🚀 I'm learning to build machine learning softwares and systems.
- 🧐 I'm also learning TypeScript and Vue.
- 👾 I'm currently interested in making my own games in Unity.
- 👨‍🎨 I'm designing science topic illustration with Ai and PS.
- 🌭 My dream: `while(sleeping){money++;}`
